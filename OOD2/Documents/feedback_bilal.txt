During the course of this project we came across many challenges, and a lot of the time our implementation of 
the project turned out to be different than we had anticipated. However I feel that we were able to cope with
all the challanges by discussing with each other all the different solutions with each other and coming up
with the best solution we saw possible. 

I believe the planning process in relation to especially composing the class diagrams helped give us a blueprint
for how the project would be implemented later on. The time spent on planning and documentation, I think saved 
us a lot of time in the implementation stage. The implementation was not entirely as we had envisioned in our
planning, but it was built on the planning framework that we had made for it. This project has been an immense
learning experience and more than the technical knowledge I believe I have gained a better understanding of how 
to solve problems in synchronisation with and input from my group members. Many ideas put together produce a 
better solution than individual ones.
