drawComponent(gr: Graphic, image: ImageList,component: Component): void

This method belongs to the System class and is used to draw a component to the drawing screen and add 
that component to the list of components belonging to the object currentNetwork. The drawComponent method
has three argument parameters which include objects of type Graphic, ImageList and Component. The Graphic
object can come from the Form's PaintEventArgs or otherwise by creating the Graphic object of the form or
a control. The ImageList consists of the images for each of the images for the components that the user 
would like to place on the drawing screen. 

The component object comes from the temComponent property of the System class. This property changes its
reference to a new Component object whenever the user clicks on a button for different components on the
toolbox. Clicking on a specific component button would create a Component of that type and change the 
tempComponents reference to that newly created Component object. The component argument in the method is
then used to call the method addComponent on the currentNetwork property of the static System class. 

The method addComponent takes an argument of type Component which would be the same as tempComponent in 
this case. The method addComponent then adds the Component to the List of Components property of Network 
class. However when the addComponent method is called there is another method call within this method to 
the method for checkOverlap method which would return a boolean. If the return value is true then the 
component would be successfully added to the list of components.

Once the component is successfully added to the list of components the Graphic object of the method will
use the location property of the component to draw the image from the ImageList corresponding to the 
component that needs to be drawn on the drawing screen.  

drawPipeLine(gr: Graphic, pipeLine: PipeLine): void

The drawPipeLine method works in a similar manner to the drawComponent method with a few notable 
differences. The drawPipeLine method takes two argument parameters, a Graphics object type and a PipeLine
object. 

The PipeLine object is created whenever the click on pipe-line button in form event is raised. In this event
the tempPipeLine property of System class is assigned a new PipeLine object without that PipeLine object 
having any start and end Component properties assigned. 

The next time whenever the user clicks on the screen the event for screeen click goes through various checks
that first include to check if the tempPipeLine is empty and if not the nested statements check for the 
following: whether the startComponent of the tempPipeLine is null and assigns a startComponent to it via 
the method findComponent, if startComponent is not null and endComponent is null and calling the method
findComponent returns a null then the point from the EventArgs is added to that tempPipeLines list of 
clickLocations and finally if startComponent is not null and endComponent is null and calling the method
findComponent returns a non-null value then the startComponent is assigned whichever component is returned 
by findComponent function unless that component is the same as the startComponent. 

Once the PipeLine object given in the drawPipeLines argument is complete in that it at least has a start 
and end Components that are non-null, then the Graphic object is used to draw the PipeLine according to 
the startComponent and endComponent locations as well as the locations given in the list of clickLocations
of the PipeLine object from the parameter.
