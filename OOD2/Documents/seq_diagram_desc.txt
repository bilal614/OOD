drawComponent(gr: Graphic, image: ImageList,component: Component): void

This method belongs to the System class and is used to draw a component to the drawing screen and add 
that component to the list of components belonging to the object currentNetwork. The drawComponent method
has three argument parameters which include objects of type Graphic, ImageList and Component. The Graphic
object can come from the Form's PaintEventArgs or otherwise by creating the Graphic object of the form or
a control. The ImageList consists of the images for each of the images for the components that the user 
would like to place on the drawing screen. 

The component object comes from the temComponent property of the System class. This property changes its
reference to a new Component object whenever the user clicks on a button for different components on the
toolbox. Clicking on a specific component button would create a Component of that type and change the 
tempComponents reference to that newly created Component object. The component argument in the method is
then used to call the method addComponent on the currentNetwork property of the static System class. 

The method addComponent takes an argument of type Component which would be the same as tempComponent in 
this case. The method addComponent then adds the Component to the List of Components property of Network 
class. However when the addComponent method is called there is another method call within this method to 
the method for checkOverlap method which would return a boolean. If the return value is true then the 
component would be successfully added to the list of components.

Once the component is successfully added to the list of components the Graphic object of the method will
use the location property of the component to draw the image from the ImageList corresponding to the 
component that needs to be drawn on the drawing screen.
